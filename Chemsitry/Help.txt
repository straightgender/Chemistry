Please don't freak out if chrome opens up in background
I had to use a version of selenium where headless mode isn't bug-free
If the compound shows wrong structure, hover over the chrome in your taskbar.
If you are able to see the correct structure, click on the search icon one more time


Again, this used to work when selenium was actually good. Now it is full of bugs. I think.
